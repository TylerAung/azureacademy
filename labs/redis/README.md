# Azure Cache for Redis

Redis is a popular open-source technology which is a combination of a messaging service and a data store. It's very lean to run and has a straightforward programming interface. It's very commonly used as a cache for non-critical data, or for async communication where reliable messaging is not needed. Azure Cache for Redis is a fully managed service which implemetns the Redis API and is a straight swap for a run-your-own Redis cluster.

## Create a Redis Cache

Create a new resource and search for _redis_ - there are lots of matches. Redis is an open-source project and different vendors package it to run on Azure. Select _Azure Cache for Redis_ (**not** _Azure Cache for Redis Enterprise & Flash_). Check the configuration options:

- Public DNS name will use the suffix `redis.cache.windows.net`
- Cache type is the pricing tier and defines capacity & reliability
- Virtual networks are available for higher tiers only
- You can choose an unsecured (non-TLS) connection, and the Redis version

We'll create a Redis instance in the CLI:

```
az group create -n labs-redis -l southeastasia --tags courselabs=azure

# note that you can use a JSON file for more advanced config options:
az redis create --help

# create a minimal instance with Redis v6:
az redis create --sku Basic --vm-size c0 --minimum-tls-version 1.2 --redis-version 6 -g labs-redis -n labsredises # <unique-dns-name>
```

## Run the Pi app

```
# no cache - takes a few seconds:
dotnet run --project ./src/pi -dp 1000
```

Get the Redis connection string - from the Portal, or build it up from the CLI:

```
az redis list-keys -g labs-redis -n labsredises # <unique-dns-name>

dotnet run --project ./src/pi -dp 1000 -usecache -cs 'labsredises.redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password=I5BB5bfjXj4ymvfwL3viY82G1cEHO2XCTAzCaPkvPF8=,ssl=True,abortConnect=False' 
```

## Check the data in Redis

In the Portal open the _Console_ from the  Redis blade.

This is the Redis CLI, already connected to your Redis instance.

Check the data - the cache key is PI followed by the number of decimal places:

```
GET pi-1000
```

The data is read-write from any process with access:

```
DELpi-1000 
```

Run the app again and it will have a cache miss and re-calculate:

```
dotnet run --project ./src/pi -dp 1000 -usecache -cs 'labsredises.redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password=I5BB5bfjXj4ymvfwL3viY82G1cEHO2XCTAzCaPkvPF8=,ssl=True,abortConnect=False' 
```

> Redis is not critical - the app works correctly without the cache, but responses take longer

## Subscribe for events

Redis also supports pub-sub messaging in the same instance that you use for data storage.

In the console window subscribe to messages on the channel used by the Pi app:

```
SUBSCRIBE events.pi.computed
```

In your own terminal, calculate some Pi values:

```
dotnet run --project ./src/pi -dp 100 -usecache -publishevents -cs 'labsredises.redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password=I5BB5bfjXj4ymvfwL3viY82G1cEHO2XCTAzCaPkvPF8=,ssl=True,abortConnect=False' 

dotnet run --project ./src/pi -dp 200 -usecache -publishevents -cs 'labsredises.redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password=I5BB5bfjXj4ymvfwL3viY82G1cEHO2XCTAzCaPkvPF8=,ssl=True,abortConnect=False' 

dotnet run --project ./src/pi -dp 300 -usecache -publishevents -cs 'labsredises.redis.cache.windows.net:6380,password=I5BB5bfjXj4ymvfwL3viY82G1cEHO2XCTAzCaPkvPF8=,ssl=True,abortConnect=False' 
```

Check in the Azure Portal and you will see the events being published.

## Lab

Redis isn't a reliable message queue like Service Bus or Event Hubs. What happens if you have mutiple subscriber consoles and then calculate Pi, do they all receive the event? What if there are no subscribers running when you publish events from the Pi app?
